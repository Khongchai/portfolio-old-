        I'm a web dev, and I'm interested in ALL SORTS of stuff; I love
        creating, learning, and solving problems! My current focus is mostly on
        architecting and understanding the entire process of getting a project
        from the ground to the moon. This portfolio, for example, has several
        components coded from scratch; its admin interface, the animations,
        linking backend to redis -- you name it!

        My focus is neither on the backend nor frontend; I do them because they
        are a part of the process that I need to do to achieve my goals.
        However, just between you and me, I really dig frontend stuff,
        especially animations!

        My projects range from an interactive binaural music application for
        Android (Java) to an e-commerce website (in progress) where I sell my
        music (I'm also a composer, you see). Other than the necessary
        frameworks I already need to learn in order to build my applications,
        other stuff that I'm also learning are Calculus, Linear Algebra,
        threeJS, and Go.

        So Iâ€™m doing so many things all at once, what then, you may be asking,
        is my passion? Learning!
