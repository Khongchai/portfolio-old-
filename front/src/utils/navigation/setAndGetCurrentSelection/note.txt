This set of utils is responsible for passing on and reading the currently selected value to/from localStorage, queryParam, and the reactState.

Put readFrromParamOrStargeAndSet() and updateQueryParamOnChange() in the responsible component and call setToLocalStorageAndSelectedState() to
set the change. The value will propagate to all the required places.

updatequeryParamOnChange is in useEffect because it needs to wait until projTitle finishes loading to perform the required action.
