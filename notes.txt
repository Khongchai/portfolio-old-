Finish modelling database relationship: add field for link to tech's website, field for logo (link to the logo), and github field for project

TODO: 
add auth system so that only superuser can edit page // technologies should be able to add projects as well // add fields for github link, website link, and short description
 add more data to backend so that you can begin implementing the relay pagination.

Change resolvers to work with the new datashape

CRUD for both project and technology resolvers.


Try adding projects, see if it works, then add website link then work on the look of the filter page;


Come up with a better error return for project creation//updation error;


Once the filter page is finished, try adding subscriptions to it: https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/advanced/subscriptions/

combine both the info viewer and the list in the filter page together and export both through index field
