TODO: 
add auth system so that only superuser can edit page // technologies should be able to add projects as well // add fields for github link, website link, and short description
 add more data to backend so that you can begin implementing the relay pagination.


CRUD for both project and technology resolvers.

use the trick from the card thing to reduce the opacity of all the things that are not hovered
in the projects bar.

why does search value reset when navbar is collapsed and reopened?

in "See all" mode, make it so that it is possible to look up by name as well.
the sorting by date and asc should all be moved to "see all" page only

Timeline:


TODO => If seeAll is enabled, extend the "projects" view to full screen and change the graphql req point to one  that queries for everything 




Finalizing:

    For next database mockup, make sure all technologies are stored as lower case letters so that you can look up name of technologies leasily. 
    For now, the first letter is capitalized.

Home/timeline page --------------------------------------------------------------------------

clear projects and technology, create new projects with varying dates and make sure that all technologies names are stored in the database in lowercase
