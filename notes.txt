backend stuff ------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
add auth system so that only superuser can edit page // technologies should be able to add projects as well // add fields for github link, website link, and short description
 add more data to backend so that you can begin implementing the relay pagination. >>> Basically a system that allows only one user
 - implement the validation middleware for all the mutations

Shared components ------------------------------------------------------------------------
If technologies are in two places, the hover descriptions will stay only on the first one (look at Apollo in VocabMem, for example);


Filter page-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

use the trick from the card thing to reduce the opacity of all the things that are not hovered
in the projects bar. <<<<<<<<<bl

write function that retrieves the dominant color of an image

Admin login button is being blocked!



Timeline:
Home/timeline page --------------------------------------------------------------------------


turn throttle thing into a class
Look for TODO in manage block move

If you accidentally drag your cursor over one of the events, it fucks up the entire timeline animation

Change style of technology descriptions and possibly remove border between each tech section.

Tweak the timeline scroll value

Look for TODO in index.tsx of Timeline



take care of the setSCrollPositionTOYearX. Right now it's moving without taking into account the 
current position of the moved elements. Can cause offset in a really big screen. Change it so that it
really moves the elements to the actual postiion OR move it to the translateX position where the user begins grabbing. <<< If there is a throttling, this won't be necessary; user won't be able to scroll very far anyway.



Set up React context so that you can broadcast the current auth status. In case you need it + good for changing
the admin login button to admin logout button.
