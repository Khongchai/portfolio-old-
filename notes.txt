Filter page-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: 
add auth system so that only superuser can edit page // technologies should be able to add projects as well // add fields for github link, website link, and short description
 add more data to backend so that you can begin implementing the relay pagination. >>> Basically a system that allows only one user


CRUD for both project and technology resolvers.

use the trick from the card thing to reduce the opacity of all the things that are not hovered
in the projects bar.

why does search value reset when navbar is collapsed and reopened?

in "See all" mode, make it so that it is possible to look up by name as well.
the sorting by date and asc should all be moved to "see all" page only

removeAllAlternateDescriptions does not remove all alternate descriptions...


optimize search regex

Timeline:


Home/timeline page --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manage timeline move

continue writing the throttle function

take care of the setSCrollPositionTOYearX. Right now it's moving without taking into account the 
current position of the moved elements. Can cause offset in a really big screen. Change it so that it
really moves the elements to the actual postiion OR move it to the translateX position where the user begins grabbing. <<< If there is a throttling, this won't be necessary; user won't be able to scroll very far anyway.


manage the projectAsEvent bottom padding

Pictures....deal with it, there's no running now.

find images
write new initialMigraiton for typeORM
combine home and filter to same section in a dropdown: view as "timeline" && "filter"

Look for TODO in timeline/index.tsx
