# Welcome to my old portfolio!

I had great plans for this portfolio, from the admin panels where I can just login and edit my site from anywhere without having to access the source code to combining different 
types of technologies that I knew together and create something out of those. Alas, my first attempt at architecting my website resulted in a web that is over-engineered 
for its purpose and difficult to maintain (for a static portfolio site). 

With all that said, I nontheless have learned a lot doing this project!
